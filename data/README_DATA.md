# Data Directory

This directory is reserved for **external input datasets** used by the microgrid optimization model.

At the current stage of the project, no external input CSV files are used.
All numerical parameters, load profiles, and generation limits are defined directly inside the GAMS model files (`scenario1.gms` and `scenario2.gms`).

This directory is intentionally kept empty to support future extensions where input data may be provided as separate files, such as:

* PV and WT generation profiles
* Critical / semi-critical / flexible load profiles
* BESS technical parameters
* Diesel generator parameters
* Economic and emission factors

Note:
Output CSV files generated by the model are located in the `results/` directory, not here.
